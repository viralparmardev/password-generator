## A quick note:

* This tool is my first Java project on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used basic Java code and terminal interface to develop the tool, keeping simplicity in mind.
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.
